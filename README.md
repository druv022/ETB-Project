# ETB-project

An Enterprise Chatbot

## Features

- Modern Python project structure
- Type hints and static type checking with MyPy
- Code formatting with Black and Ruff
- Comprehensive testing with pytest
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Docker support for containerized development
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Cursor IDE optimized with `.cursorrules`

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pip or poetry for dependency management

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/druv022/etb_project.git
cd etb_project

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Using poetry

```bash
# Install poetry if not already installed
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the application
python -m etb_project.main

# Or using make
make run
```

## Tools (not installed)

Utility scripts and side projects live under `tools/` and are **not** part of the installed package. They are for development and one-off tasks only.

### Data generation

Data generation scripts are in `tools/data_generation/`. They are not installed with `pip install .`.

**How to run:**

1. From the project root, set `PYTHONPATH` so Python can find the `tools` package:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. python -m tools.data_generation
   ```
2. Or run a specific script inside the folder:
   ```bash
   python tools/data_generation/your_script.py
   ```

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install development dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
4. Install git hooks: `pre-commit install` (installs both pre-commit and pre-push hooks; or use `make install-dev`)
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure

Pre-push hooks run the same lint and format checks as CI (Ruff, Black, MyPy) so that failed checks are caught before you push.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=etb_project --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_main.py

# Or using make
make test
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black .
ruff check --fix .

# Type checking
mypy src/etb_project

# Run all checks
make lint
make format
make type-check

# Or use pre-commit (on commit) and pre-push (before push)
pre-commit run --all-files
make pre-push   # Run lint/format check without pushing
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t etb_project:latest .

# Run container
docker-compose up

# Or using make
make docker-build
make docker-up
```
